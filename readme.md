# Pazator.

A monitoring and analytical platform
"Palantir, but not evil."


---

Overview

Pazator is a monitoring, data analysis, and intelligence system currently under development. The project explores how large scale data aggregation, automated analysis, and AI driven decision support systems can be designed and operated in a controlled, transparent manner.

This is not a demonstration project or a polished product. It is an active, evolving system intended for experimentation, learning, and exploration.


---

Purpose

It holds data, analysis's data, and stops things before they happen.

The project focuses on:

Data ingestion and structured storage

Automated analysis pipelines

AI-assisted pattern detection and forecasting

Search and correlation across large datasets

Visual representations of data and relationships



---

Core Capabilities

Pazator is being designed to support the following capabilities:

Automated data analysis and correlation

Predictive and preventative AI systems intended to identify issues before they escalate

Autonomous AI agents that operate toward defined objectives

Threat detection and early warning mechanisms

High-performance search functionality across indexed data

Visual data dashboards and analytical views

Graph-based relationship and connection visualization

---

The scope of the project is intentionally broad and continues to expand as development progresses.


This project should not be considered production-ready.
