Palantir but not evil

A simple monitoring tool I'm building for fun. It's still very much a work in progress.

What is this?

Just a personal project to mess around with data and ai. Don't expect anything fancy 

Current Status

🚧 Still building the basics. Lots of broken stuff and half-finished features.

What it does (or will do)

· Store larg amounts of data ins clean formst
· Find relations between things
· Sort, edit data with AI

Why?

Mostly to understand how this stuff works under the hood. And because it's interesting.
